#### Abstract

Studies on the association between urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and bone mineral density
(BMD) are still controversial. This study investigated the association between ACR and BMD in the
general US population using Bayesian approach. This cross-sectional study identified 2007 individuals
aged 40 or above years with complete and valid data on urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), and
femoral neck, total femur and lumbar spine BMD from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 2013-2014. ACR was directly measured with established methods. BMDs were measured by
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). After adjusting for multiple covariates, we used Bayesian
multiple linear regression to determine the association between ACR and BMD. The results show that
the mean age of participants in this study was 54.6 Â± 11.3 years; 52.6% of them were female. ACR was
negatively associated with BMD at femoral neck and total femur and positively with lumbar spine.
After adjusting for covariates, ACR was negatively associated with total femur, but with not femoral
neck and lumbar spine BMD. We conclude that ACR was negatively associated with total femur BMD
in the general US population. Future studies are warranted to confirm our results.
